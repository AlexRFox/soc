Module Description: 
	DEPP Demo demonstrates how to transfer data to and from	
	a Digilent FPGA board using the DEPP module of the Adept
	SDK.


Hardware Description:
	To use this demonstration, you will need to be connected via USB to a
	Digilent FPGA board with the DpimRef design loaded into the gate array.
	The DpimRef VHDL design and corresponding UCF files for various Digilent
	boards are availible from our website, www.digilentinc.com. Or, see the 
	VHDL file for this design in the logic directory.
