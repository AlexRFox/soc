Description
===========

Adept Utilities is a set of command line applications that can be used in
conjunction with the Adept Runtime to manage and communicate with
Digilent's devices.

Currently Adept Utilities consists of two applications: Digilent Adept
Utility (dadutil) and Digilent JTAG Config Utility (djtgcfg). The Adept
Utility provides a command line interface for discovering Digilent devices,
querying device information, manipulating the device table, and setting
device information. The JTAG Config Utility allows users to initialize,
program, and erase FPGAs and CPLDs on Digilent boards using a command line
interface.

For more information please consult the associated man documentation.


Supported Operating Systems
===========================

Adept Utilities has been built for the following distributions:

CentOS 4 / Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
CentOs 5 / Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
openSUSE 11 / SUSE Linux Enterprise 11
Ubuntu 8.04
Ubuntu 9.10
Ubuntu 10.04

Please note that limited testing has been performed for each of these
distributions. However, due to variances in system configurations Digilent
can provide no guarantee that the applications provided by Adept Utilities
will work on your system.


Dependencies
============

Adept Utilities requires the Adept Runtime. The Adept Runtime is available
for download at Digilent's website: http://www.digilentinc.com


Installation
============

Before installing Adept Utilities you must agree to the End User License
Agreement, which can be found in EULA.

For basic installation execute the included bash shell script (install.sh)
from a terminal with superuser privileges. This script installs all the
necessary components for proper functionality and should be sufficient for
most users.

If for some reason the install script doesn't work on your system or if you
would like to have more control over the installation process then read on.
The following section describes each component of Adept Utilities and
provides instructions on how the individual components may be installed.

Binaries:
	Adept Utilities consists of multiple binaries. For a 32-bit release
	these binaries can be found in the "bin" directory. For a 64-bit
	release they can be found in the "bin64" directory. The contents of the
	applicable directory should be copied to a location that is appropriate
	for the distribution that Adept Utilities is being installed on.
	
	Binaries can be installed anywhere on the system. However, if they are
	not installed in a directory that is specified as part of a users PATH
	then the user will need to provide the full path to the binary in order
	to execute it.
	
	Common installation locations are "/usr/local/bin" and "/usr/bin".
	
	Let's assume that you are running a 32-bit distribution and want to
	install the binaries provided with Adept Utilities in "/usr/local/bin".
	The following commands, when executed with superuser privileges, will
	copy the binaries to that location and set the appropriate permissions.
	
	cp -f bin/* /usr/local/bin
	chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/dadutil
	chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/djtgcfg

MAN Documentation:
	Adept Utilities contains MAN files for each of the applications it
	provides. These files can be found in the "man" directory. Once
	installed the documentation for a given application can be accessed
	from a terminal using the command "man appname".
	
	MAN files should be installed in the appropriate section of one of the
	directories shown by the "manpath" command. Common installation
	locations are "/usr/local/man", "/usr/local/share/man", and 
	"/usr/share/man".
	
	Let's assume that you want to install the MAN files included with Adept
	Utilities in "/usr/local/man". The MAN file for the Digilent Adept
	Utility is named "dadutil.1". The ".1" at the end of the filename
	specifies the section that the documentation belongs to. The following
	commands, when executed with superuser privileges, will copy the MAN
	file to the appropriate location and set the appropriate permissions.
	
	cp -f man/dadutil.1 /usr/local/man/man1
	chmod 644 /usr/local/man/man1/dadutil.1
	
	The rest of the MAN files can be installed in a similar fashion.


Known Issues
============

Users may experience problems when using the Adept Runtime in a Linux
Guest operating system with VMware Workstation. VMware Workstation does not
pass USB SET_INTERFACE requests to Windows hosts. This can result in a
failure of communication between the Linux kernel and the device. This
issue typically only appears with older Linux kernel's that send 
SET_INTERFACE requests to a USB device each time a process releases an
interface. Linux Kernels 2.6.29 and newer do not appear to suffer from this
problem. The following distributions are known to use kernels that suffer
from this problem: CentOS 5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and Ubuntu 8.04.

If you are using a different Linux distribution and you are unsure which
kernel version your distribution is using then you can execute the command
"uname -r" to determine the kernel version.

If you are using VMware and are experience problems while communicating
with Digilent's USB devices then you can try setting the following
environment variable: "ADEPT_SETIFWAEN=1". Setting this environment
variable enables a workaround for SET_INTERFACE requests. While this may
allow you to successfully communicate with Digilent's USB devices when
using Linux as a VMware guest it is not recommended as a permanent
solution. A better solution is to upgrade to a newer Kernel and use Linux
outside of VMware.

Testing has shown that newer Linux kernels (2.6.29+) perform significantly
better when communicating with USB devices. If you are using the Adept
Runtime to interface with one of Digilent's USB devices and communication
seems slow then try upgrading to a newer kernel.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 / CentOS 4 uses an older version of UDEV which
does NOT create entries for USB devices in "/dev". Without these entries
a UDEV permissions file can not be used to grant all users read and write
access for all Digilent USB devices. As a result it is necessary to have
superuser privileges when using the Adept Runtime with either of these
distributions.
