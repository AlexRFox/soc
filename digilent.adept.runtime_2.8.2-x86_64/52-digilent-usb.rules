#  This file contains the rules used by UDEV when creating entries for    #
#  Digilent USB devices. In order for Digilent's shared libraries and     #
#  applications to access these devices without root privalages it is     #
#  necessary for UDEV to create entries for which all users have read     #
#  and write permission.                                                  #
#                                                                         #
#  Usage:                                                                 #
#                                                                         #
#  Copy this file to "/etc/udev/rules.d/" and execute                     #
#  "/sbin/udevcontrol reload_rules" as root. This only needs to be done   #
#  immediately after installation. Each time you reboot your system the   #
#  rules are automatically loaded by UDEV.                                #

# Create "/dev" entries for Digilent device's with read and write
# permission granted to all users.
SYSFS{idVendor}=="1443", MODE="666"
ACTION=="add", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{manufacturer}=="Digilent", MODE="666", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/dftdrvdtch %s{busnum} %s{devnum}"

# The following rules (if present) cause UDEV to ignore all UEVENTS for
# which the subsystem is "usb_endpoint" and the action is "add" or
# "remove". These rules are necessary to work around what appears to be a
# bug in the Kernel used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5/CentOS 5. The Kernel
# sends UEVENTS to remove and then add entries for the endpoints of a USB
# device in "/dev" each time a process releases an interface. This occurs
# each time a data transaction occurs. When an FPGA is configured or flash
# device is written a large number of transactions take place. If the
# following lines are commented out then UDEV will be overloaded for a long
# period of time while it tries to process the massive number of UEVENTS it
# receives from the kernel. Please note that this work around only applies
# to systems running RHEL5 or CentOS 5 and as a result the rules will only
# be present on those systems.
